## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹


**Hi everyone! I'm Leo, a computer science major. Growing up, I loved playing computer games, and when I learned that anyone could code up a game, I begged my Mom to get a tutor for me. Since then, I've built many projects: a healthcare app, a reef safety game, and a website for my Mom's cafe. I am excited to continue coding new projects and sharing my work with everyone!**
